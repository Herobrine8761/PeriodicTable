## Idea
This came up to me while studying - I needed an interactive periodic table! I went on a scavenger hunt to find the perfect one for me. I found this, but the original creator of this code had lost in time. I cannot link them here as I don't know where I can find any of their socials, but still, a huge thanks to him for making this.
